upgradeTowerDecreasesMoneyTest(): This test checks if the upgrading of a tower reduces the cash the player has. It checks this attribute of upgrading tower all 3 levels: easy, medium, and hard. It is an important test to M6 because one of the milestone requirements asks us to allow users to use money to upgrade their towers, and that money reduction is checked here.

validTowerUpgradeTest(): This test includes testing all possible valid cash combinations that can be used to upgrade a tower. It checks for invalid upgrades like when the user does not have sufficient cash to be able to upgrade a tower and ensures that such cases are not allowed. It is an important test to M6 because one of the milestone requirements asks us to allow users to upgrade their towers, and that should only be allowed when users have enough money.

upgradeIncreasesTowerDamageTest(): This test checks for whether upgrading a tower increases the damage dealt by the tower on enemies or not. Specifically, it checks whether the damage dealt increases by double or not. This tested for both the final boss and regular enemies. It is an important test as one of the requirements of M6 is to make sure the upgrade enhances the tower's abilities and this test checks for that.

finalBossHigherHealthTest(): This test checks for whether the final boss has a higher stamina (health) than the regular enemies. This is checked for in every level of the game. It is an important test because one of the tenets of milestone 6 is to make sure that the final boss is different from normal enemies and the health is one way in which it is different.

finalBossExperiencesLessDamageTest(): This test checks for whether the damage dealt to the final enemy is less than it is for normal enemies. Specifically, damages dealt by towers to normal enemies should be twice the damage dealt to the boss enemy. This is an important test as it ensures the requirement of M6 that final boss should be more difficult to deafeat than normal enemies and less damage dealt is doing just that.

finalBossWinTest(): This test checks if the killing of the final boss leads to the player winning the game or not. Specifically, it tests for various conditions to make sure that only killing the final boss and not any other enemy or reducing damage to the final boss leads to the user winning. This test is important as it addresses the requirement of M6 of victory being acheieved after killing the final boss.
